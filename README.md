## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Arjun

I'm an AI engineer and open-source contributor focused on machine learning systems, tooling, and research-backed development.  
I contribute to work on core components like iterable datasets, data loading, and configuration logic.

I enjoy building ML-powered tools â€” from Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems and fine-tuned models to cloud-native APIs with real-world impact.  
My workflow blends fast iteration, clean architecture, and collaborative problem-solving â€” especially in open source communities.
